    <p>
      A few weeks ago I was reading a charmingly written book by a lady (the
      wife of a distinguished savant) who had spent three months on Funafuti,
      one of the lagoon islands of the Ellice Group. Now the place and the brown
      people of whom she wrote were once very familiar to me, and her warm and
      generous sympathy for a dying race stirred me greatly, and when I came
      across the name "Funâfala," old, forgotten memories awoke once more, and I
      heard the sough of the trade wind through the palms and the lapping of the
      lagoon waters upon the lonely beaches of Funâfala, as Senior, the mate of
      the <i>Venus</i>, and myself watched the last sleep of Susâni.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funâfala is one of the many islands which encircle Funafuti lagoon with a
      belt of living green, and to Funâfala&mdash;"the island of the pandanus
      palm"&mdash;Senior and I had come with a party of natives from the village
      on the main island to spend a week's idleness. Fifty years ago, long
      before the first missionary ship sailed into the lagoon, five or six
      hundred people dwelt on Funâfala in peace and plenty&mdash;now it holds
      but their bones, for they were doomed to fade and vanish before the breath
      of the white man and his civilisation and "benefits," which to the brown
      people mean death, and as the years went by, the remnant of the people on
      Funâfala and the other islets betook themselves to the main island&mdash;after
      which the lagoon is named&mdash;for there the whale-ships and trading
      schooners came to anchor, and there they live to this day, smitten with
      disease and fated to disappear altogether within another thirty years, and
      be no more known to man except in the dry pages of a book written by some
      learned ethnologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But twice every year the people of Funafuti betake themselves to Funâfala
      to gather the cocoa-nuts, which in the silent groves ripen and fall and
      lie undisturbed from month to month; then for a week or ten days, as the
      men husk the nuts, the women and children fish in the daytime among the
      pools and runnels of the inner reef, and at night with flaring torches of
      palm-leaf they stand amid the sweeping surf on the outer side of the
      narrow islet, and with net and spear fill their baskets with blue and
      yellow crayfish. Then when all the work is done, the canoes are filled
      with the husked cocoanuts, and with laughter and song&mdash;for they are
      yet a merry-hearted though vanishing people&mdash;they return to the
      village, and for another six months Funâfala is left to the ceaseless call
      of the restless sea upon the outer reef, and the hoarse cry of the soaring
      frigate birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Senior and myself, accompanied by a young, powerfully-built
      native named Suka, were returning to the temporary village on Funâfala&mdash;a
      collection of rude huts thatched with palm leaves&mdash;from a fishing
      excursion on the outer reef, when we were overtaken by a series of sudden
      squalls and downpours of rain. We were then walking along the weather
      shore of the island, which was strewn with loose slabs of coral stone,
      pure white in colour and giving forth a clear, resonant sound to the
      slightest disturbing movement On our right hand was a scrub of <i>puka</i>
      trees, which afforded no shelter from the torrential rain; on our left the
      ocean, whose huge, leaping billows crashed and thundered upon the black,
      shelving reef, and sent swirling waves of whitened foam up to our feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes we continued to force our way against the storm, when
      Suka, who was leading, called out to us that a little distance on along
      the beach there was a cluster of <i>pàpà</i> (coral rocks), in the
      recesses of which we could obtain shelter. Even as he spoke the rain
      ceased for a space, and we saw, some hundreds of yards before us, the spot
      of which he had spoken&mdash;a number of jagged, tumbled-together coral
      boulders which some violent convulsion of the sea had torn away from the
      barrier reef and hurled upon the shore, where, in the course of years,
      kindly Nature had sent out a tender hand and covered them with a thick
      growth of a creeper peculiar to the low-lying atolls of the mid-Pacific,
      and hidden their rugged outlines under a mantle of vivid green.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drew near, the bright, tropic sun shone out for a while, and the
      furious wind died away, seeming to gather fresh strength for another
      sweeping onslaught from the darkened weather horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick," said Suka, pointing to the rocks, "'tis bad to be smitten with
      such rain as this. Let us rest in the <i>pàpà</i> till the storm be over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Following our all but naked guide, who sprang from stone to stone with the
      surefootedness of a mountain goat, we soon reached the cluster of rocks,
      the bases of which were embedded in the now hard and stiffened sand, and
      almost at the same moment another heavy rain squall swept down and blurred
      sea and sky and land alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding us to follow, Suka began to clamber up the side of the highest of
      the boulders, on the seaward face of which, he said, was a small cave,
      used in the olden days as a sleeping place by fishermen and sea-bird
      catchers. Suddenly, when half-way up, he stopped and turned to us, and
      with a smile on his face, held up his hand and bade us listen. Some one
      was singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Susani," he whispered, "she did not sleep in the village last
      night. She comes to this place sometimes to sing to the sea. Come, she is
      not afraid of white men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grasping the thick masses of green vine called <i>At At</i> which hung
      from the summit of the rock, we at last reached the foot of the cave, and
      looking up we saw seated at the entrance a young native girl of about
      twelve years of age. Even though we were so near to her she seemed utterly
      unconscious of our presence, and still sang in a low, soft voice some
      island chant, the words of which were strange to both my companion and
      myself although we were well acquainted with nearly all the <i>Tokelauan</i>
      dialects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly we stood awaiting till she turned her face towards us, but
      her eyes were bent seaward upon the driving sheets of rain, and the
      tumbling surf which thrashed upon the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait," said Suka in a low voice; "she will see us soon. 'Tis best not to
      disturb her. She is afflicted of God and seeth many things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her song ceased, and then Suka, stepping forward, touched her gently upon
      the arm. She looked up and smiled into his face, and then she let her
      full, dark eyes rest upon the strangers who stood behind, then again she
      turned to Suka in mute, inquiring wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and placed his cheek against hers, "Be not afraid, Susâni;
      they be good friends. And see, little one, sit thee further back within
      the cave, for the driving rain beats in here at the mouth and thy feet are
      wet and cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose without a word and stood whilst the kindly-hearted native
      unrolled an old mat which lay at the end of the cave and spread it out in
      the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Susâni, dear one," he said gravely, and his usually harsh and
      guttural voice sounded soft and tender. "Come, sit thee here, and then in
      a little while shall I get wood and make a fire so that we may eat. Hast
      eaten to-day, little one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head; a faint smile parted her lips, and then her strange,
      mournful eyes for a moment again sought ours as she seated herself on the
      mat Suka beckoned us to approach and sit near her, himself sitting a
      little apart and to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Susâni," he said, bending forward and speaking slowly and carefully, "<i>fealofani
      tau lima i taka soa</i>" ("give your hand to my friends ").
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl held out her left hand, and Senior and I each took it in turn
      gently within our own, and uttered the native greeting of "<i>Fakaalofa</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can talk," said Suka, "but not much. Sometimes for many days no word
      will come from her lips. It is then she leaveth the village and walks
      about in the forest or along the beaches when others sleep. But no harm
      can come to her, for she is <i>tausi mau te Atua</i>.{*} And be not vexed
      in that she gave thee her left hand, for, see&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In God's special keeping.
</pre>
    <p>
      He touched the girl's right arm, and we now saw that it hung limp and
      helpless upon her smooth, bared thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she born thus?" asked Senior, as he placed his strong, rough hand
      upon her head and stroked her thick, wavy hair, which fell like a mantle
      over her shoulders and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, she was born a strong child, and her mother and father were without
      blemish, and good to look upon&mdash;the man was as thick as me" (he
      touched his own brawny chest), "but as she grew and began to talk, the
      bone in her right arm began to perish. And then the hand of God fell upon
      her mother and father, and they died. But let me go get wood and broil
      some fish, for she hath not eaten." Then he bent forward and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dost fear to stay here, Susâni, with the white men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at us in turn, and then said slowly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I have no fear, Suka."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little beggar!" said Senior pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Suka had returned with an armful of dry wood and some
      young drinking cocoanuts. Fish we had in plenty, and in our bags were some
      biscuits, brought from the schooner. As Senior and I tended the fire, Suka
      wrapped four silvery sea mullet in leaves, and then when it had burnt down
      to a heap of glowing coals he laid them in the centre and watched them
      carefully, speaking every now and then to the child, who seemed scarcely
      to heed, as she gazed at Senior's long, yellow beard, and his bright, blue
      eyes set in his honest, sun-tanned face. Then, when the fish were cooked,
      Suka turned them out of their coverings and placed them on broad, freshly
      plucked <i>puka</i> leaves, and Senior brought the hard ship biscuits,
      and, putting one beside a fish, brought it to the child and bade her eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out her left hand timidly, and took it from him, her strange eyes
      still fixed wonderingly upon his face. Then she looked at Suka, and Suka,
      with an apologetic cough, placed one hand over his eyes and bent his head&mdash;for
      he was a deacon, and to eat food without giving thanks would be a terrible
      thing to do, at least in the presence of white men, who, of course, never
      neglected to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, hungry as she must have been, ate her food with a dainty grace,
      though she had but one hand to use, and our little attentions to her every
      now and then seemed at first to increase her natural shyness and timidity.
      But when the rude meal was finished, and my companion and myself filled
      our pipes and sat in the front of the cave, she came with Suka and nestled
      up against his burly figure as he rolled a cigarette of strong, black
      tobacco in dried banana leaf. The rain had ceased, but the fronds of the
      coco-palms along the lonely shore swayed and beat together with the wind,
      which still blew strongly, though the sun was now shining brightly upon
      the white horses of the heaving sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly half an hour we sat thus, watching the roll and curl of the
      tumbling seas upon the reef and the swift flight of a flock of savage-eyed
      frigate birds which swept to and fro, now high in air, now low down, with
      wing touching wave, in search of their prey, and listening to the song of
      the wind among the trees. Then Suka, without speaking, smiled, and pointed
      to the girl. She had pillowed her head upon his naked bosom and closed her
      long-lashed eyes in slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will sleep long," he said. "Will it vex thee if I stay here with her
      till she awakens? See, the sky is clear and the rain hath ceased, and ye
      need but walk along the beach till&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will wait, Suka," I answered; "we will wait till she awakens, and then
      return to the village together. How comes it that one so young and tender
      is left to wander about alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suka pressed his lips to the forehead of the sleeping girl. "No harm can
      come to her. God hath afflicted, but yet doth He protect her. And she
      walketh with Him and His Son Christ, else had she perished long ago, for
      sometimes she will leave us and wander for many days in the forest or
      along the shore, eating but little and drinking nothing, for she cannot
      open a cocoanut with her one hand, and there are no streams of fresh,
      sweet water here as there be in the fair land of Samoa. And yet God is
      with her always, always, and she feeleth hunger and thirst but little."
    </p>
    <p>
      Senior placed his hand on mine and gripped it so firmly that I looked at
      him with astonishment He was a cold, self-contained man, making no
      friends, never talking about himself, doing his duty as mate of the <i>Venus</i>
      as a seaman should do it, and never giving any one&mdash;even myself, with
      whom he was more open than any other man&mdash;any encouragement to ask
      him why he, a highly educated and intelligent man, had left civilisation
      to waste his years as a wanderer in the South Seas. Still grasping my
      hand, he turned to me and spoke with quivering lips&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "' She walketh with God! 'Did you hear that? Did you look into her eyes
      and not see in them what fools would call insanity, and what I <i>know</i>
      is a knowledge of God above and Christ and the world beyond. 'God has
      afflicted her,' so this simple-minded native, whom many men in their
      unthinking moments would call a canting, naked kanaka, says; but God has
      <i>not</i> afflicted her. He has blessed her, for in her eyes there is
      that which tells me better than all the deadly-dull sermons of the highly
      cultured and fashionable cleric, who patters about the Higher Life, or the
      ranting Salvationist who bawls in the streets of Melbourne or Sydney about
      the Blood of the Lamb, that there <i>is</i> peace beyond for all.... 'God
      has afflicted this poor child!' Would that He might so afflict me
      physically as He has afflicted her&mdash;if He but gave me that inner
      knowledge of Himself which so shines out and is glorified in her face."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice, rising in his excitement, nearly awakened her; so Suka, with
      outstretched hand, enjoined silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sleeps, dear friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had come and gone, and the <i>Venus</i> again lay at anchor in the
      broad lagoon of Funafuti. Suka had come aboard whilst the schooner was
      beating up to the anchorage, and said that there had been much sickness on
      the island, that many people had died, and that Susâni with other children
      was <i>tali mate</i> (nearly dead). Could we give them some medicine? for
      it was a strong sickness this, and even the "thick"{*} man or woman
      withered and died from it. Soon they would all be dead.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I.e., strong, stout.
</pre>
    <p>
      Alas! we could not help them much, for our medicine chest was long since
      depleted of the only drug that would have been of service. At every island
      in the group from Nanomea southwards we had found many of the people
      suffering and dying from a malignant type of fever introduced by an
      Hawaiian labour vessel. Then an additional misfortune followed&mdash;a
      heavy gale, almost of hurricane force, had set in from the westward and
      destroyed countless thousands of cocoanut trees, so that with the
      exception of fish, food was very scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sent Suka on shore in the boat at once with a few mats of rice and bags
      of biscuit&mdash;all the provisions we could spare. Then as soon as the
      vessel was anchored the captain, Senior, and myself followed. The resident
      native teacher met us on the beach, his yellow face and gaunt frame
      showing that he, too, had been attacked. Many of the people, he told us,
      had gone to the temporary village on Funâfala, where a little more food
      could be obtained than on the main island, the groves of palms there not
      having suffered so severely from the gale. Among those who had gone were
      Susâni and the family who had adopted her, and we heard with sorrow that
      there was no hope of the child living, for that morning some natives had
      arrived from Funâfala with the news that nearly all the young children
      were dead, and those remaining were not expected to live beyond another
      day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending an hour with the teacher, and watching him distribute the
      rice and biscuit among his sick and starving people, we returned to the
      ship with the intention of sailing down to Funâfala in the boat and taking
      the natives there some provisions. The teacher thanked us warmly, but
      declined to come with us, saying that he could not leave the many for the
      few, "for," he added sadly, "who will read the service over those who die?
      As you sail down the lagoon you will meet canoes coming up from Funâfala
      bringing the dead. I cannot go there to bury them."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly midnight when we put off from the schooner's side, but with
      Suka as pilot we ran quickly down to the island. A few natives met us as
      we stepped on shore, and to these we gave the provisions we had brought,
      telling them to divide them equally. Then with Suka leading, and carrying
      a lighted torch made from the spathe of the cocoanut tree, we made our way
      through the darkened forest to the house in which Susâni and her people
      were living. It was situated on the verge of the shore, on the weather
      side of the narrow island, so as to be exposed to the cooling breath of
      the trade wind, and consisted merely of a roof of thatch with open sides,
      and the ground within covered with coarse mats, upon which we saw were
      lying three figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making as little noise as possible Suka called out a name, and a man threw
      off his sleeping mat and came out; it was Susâni's adopted father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said in his simple manner, in answer to our inquiries, "Susâni is
      not yet dead, but she will die at dawn when the tide is low. 'Tis now her
      last sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping very softly inside the house so as not to disturb her, we sat
      down to wait her awakening. Suka crouched near us, smoking his pipe in
      silence, and watching the sleeping girl to see if she moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the weird cries of the tropic birds heralded the approach of dawn,
      the woman who lay beside Susâni rose and looked into her face. Then she
      bade us come nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is awake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child knew us at once, even in that imperfect light, for the moment
      Senior and myself stood up she tried to raise herself into a sitting
      posture; in an instant Suka sprang to her aid and pillowed her head upon
      his knees; weak as she was, she put out her hand to us, and then let it
      lie in the mate's broad palm, her deep, mysterious eyes resting upon his
      face with a strange look of happiness shining in them. Presently her lips
      moved, and we all bent over her to listen; it was but one word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
